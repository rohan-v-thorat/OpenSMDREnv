# openSMDREnv: Reinforcement Learning environment for spring-mass-damper system
Rohan Thorat, Juhi Singh, Prof. Rajdip Nayek IITD

This package includes 1-dof, 3-dof, 5-dof and 76-dof dynamical system environment. The 76-dof dynamical system is of 76-story 306 m concrete office tower proposed for the city of Melbourne, Australia. It is a benchmark system which is usually used in the domain of mechanical and civil engineering.

User have the flexibility to change the default mass, spring, damper properties.

Requires:
* `numpy`

*We hope you find this code helpful*
